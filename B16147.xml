            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>¶ why Tindale vsed this worde congregacion rather thē church in the translacion of the new testament.</head>
                  <p>VVherfore in as moch (as the clergye as the nature of those hard &amp; indurat adamādsto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes is / to draw all to them) had appropriat vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them selues the terme that of right is comen vnto all the hole congregacion of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in christe and with their false and sotle wy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les had begyled and mocked the people and bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ught them in to the ignoraunce of the worde / makynge them vnderstonde by this word chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch / nothinge but the shauēflocke / of them that shore the hole world: therfore in the translacion of the new testament where I found this word ecclesia / Ienterpretated it / bi this worde congre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gacion. Even therfore did I it / and not of any mischevouse minde or purpose to stablishe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heresie / as master More vntrulye reporteth of me in his dialoge where he rayleth on the trans<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lacion of the new testament</p>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:176385:7"/>
                  <p> And when. M. More saith / y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> this word ch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>urch is knowen well ynough / I reporte me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conscyences of all the londe / whether he saie truth or otherwise / or whether the laye peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple vnderstonde by church the hole multytude of all that professe christe / or the iuglinge spry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes onlye. And when he saith that congregacion is a moore generall terme / iff yt were yt hurteth not. for the circumstaunce doeth ever tell what congregacyon ys ment. Neuerthelesse yet sayth he not the truth. For whersoeuer I maye saye a congregacyon / there maye I saye a church al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so as the church of the deuell / the church of sathan / the church of wretches / the church of wekedmen / the church of lyers and a church of turkes therto₊</p>
                  <p>For. M. More must graūt (if he will have ecclesia translated thorowte all the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt by thys word church) that church is as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as ecclesia. Now is ecclesia a greke worde and was in vse before the tyme of the apostles and taken for a congregacyon amonge the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then / where was no congregacion of god or of christ. And also Lucas hym selfe vseth ecclesia for a church or congregacyon of hethen people thrise in one chapther even in the .xix. of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes / where Demetrius the goldsmyth or syluer smyth had gathered a cōpanie agenst paul for <note place="margin">Actes. 19.</note> preachynge agenst ymages₊</p>
                  <p>How be it. M. More hath so lōge vsed hys figures of poetrie / y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> (I suppose) whē he erreth most / he now by the reason of a longe custome / beleueth him selfe / that he saith most true. Or else (as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wyse people whych when they daunce naked in nettes beleve that no man seyth thē) even so. M. More thynketh that his erroures
<pb facs="tcp:176385:8"/> be so subtilly cowched that no man can espye them. So blinde he coūteth all other men in cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of his great vnderstondinge. But chari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tablye I exhorte him in chryste to take hede for <note place="margin">Iudas</note> though Iudas were wilier then his felowes to get lucre / yet he proued not most wise at y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> last ende. Nether though Balam the false phophete <note place="margin">Balaam</note> had a clere sighte to bringe y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> curse of God vppō the chyldern of Israel for honoures sake / yet his couetousenesse did so blynd his prophesie / Y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he coude not se his awne ende.

                  <p> And in the seconde mariage or tenth and ye will / the man hath but one wife and all his is hirs / and his other wiues be in a lande where is no husbonde or wife. I saye therfore with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ul that this is deuellish doctrine and hath a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of godlynesse with it but the power is a waye. The myst of it blindeth the eyes of the simple and begyleth them / that they can not se a thousande abhominacions wrought vnder y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> clocke.</p>
                  <p>And therfore I saye still / that the apostles meaninge was that he shuld haue a wife / if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his age were not y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> gretter / and that by one wife he excludeth them that had two and them that were defamed with other saue their aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne wiues / and wolde haue them to be soch as were knowen of vertuouse liuynge / for to doo reuerence and honoure vn to the doctrine of Christe.

And when Master More to mocke / bringeth forth the texte of the wedowe / that she must be the wife of one man.

I wold to god for his mercy that it were not y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> gyse this daye / and then I am sure his wrath wold not be so greate as it is. Paul meaneth only y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> he wold haue no diffamed woman cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen wedowe for dishonourynge y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> worde of god
<pb n="xcvij" facs="tcp:176385:99"/> and the congregacion of Christ / and therfore ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cludeth comen wemen and soch as were dyffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med besydes their husbandes and haply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced therto. And that I proue by the same do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrine of Paule / that the kyngdome of god is no soch busynes but the kepynge of gods com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandementes only and to loue one a nother. Now loke on the thynge and on the office of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> wedowe. It was but to wayte on the sicke and pore people ād to washe straungers fete. Now the wedowes of .x. husbādes must haue be foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de of the cost of the congregacion / iff they were destitute of frendes / as all other pore were / tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ugh in tyme passed they haue bene diffamed per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p>But vnder .lx. wold Paul let none ministre for feare of occasions of vnchastite / and therto none but soch as were well knowen of honeste liuynge and of good reporte. Now in as moch as the wedow of .x. husbandes must be founde of the comen cost at hir nede / what vnclennesse is in hir by the reason of hir seconde husbonde / that she is not good ynough to be a seruaunte vn to the pore people / to dresse their meate / to wash their clothes / to make their beddes and so forth and to wash straūgers fete / that came out of one congregacion vn to a nother a bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te busynesse / and to doo all maner seruice of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vn to her pore brethern and sisters.

And therfore they shame not our doctrine ner oure congregacion / 
<pb facs="tcp:176385:100"/> ner dishonoure god amonge the hethen or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Christen. Now when we haue a playne rule that he whych loueth his neyboure as him selfe kepeth all the lawes of god / lett him tell me for <note place="margin">Roma. 13.</note> what cause of loue towarde his neyboure / a we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowe of two lawfull husbandes maye not doo seruice vn to the pore people₊</p>
                  <p>Vvhy maye not a wedowe of .l. doo seruice vn to the pore? paule whych knitteth no snares ner leadeth vs blinde ner teacheth vs wyth out a reason geuynge of his doctrine / answereth / for feare of occasions of euell / lest she be tempted or tempte other: And then if she be taken in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sdoenge / the doctrine of Christ be euell spoke of therto and the weake offended.</p>
                  <p>And when Master More mocheth wyth my reason that I wolde haue euery preest to ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue a wife because fewe mē can liue chaste / I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere / that if he loued the honoure of Christ ād his neyboure as he doeth his awne couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse / he shuld finde that a good argumente.

And it is a fer lesse rebuke to the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Christ and his congregaciō / that a womā shuld doo amisse / then the bisshope or preest.

Christes appostles consyde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red all infirmities and all that might hindre the doctrine of Christe / and therfore did their beste to preuent all occasions. Vvherfore as fish is no better then flesh / ner flesh better then fish in the kyngdome of Christ / euen so virginite wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke and wedowed are none better then other to be saued by in their awne nature or to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se good with all / but with whatsoeuer I maye best serue my brethern / that is euer best acordin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge vn to the tyme and facion of the worlde.

And in the spiritualtye they excomunicat him &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke an heretike of him.

And in like case where to be with out a wife helpeth moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to kepe the commaundementes and to serue a mans neyboure / there yt is better to be vnma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried then maried / and where a wife helpeth too kepe the commaundementes better then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with out / there it is better to haue a wife then to be with out.

                  <p>And when he wyll haue the prestes to liue chaste / for reuerence off the sacramentes yt ys deuellish doctrine hauinge the similitude of god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lynesse / but the pith and mary is awaye. If he meane water / oyle salt and soch like / then is the

                  <p>And when he disputeth / if they that haue <note place="margin">Alone</note> faith / haue loue vn to the law and purpose to fulfill it / then fayth alone iustifieth not / how will he proue that argumēt? he iugleth with this worde alone: and wold make the people beleue that we said / how a bare faith that is with out all other companye / of repentaunce / loue and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues / ye and with out gods spirite to / did iustifie vs / so that we shuld not care to doo good. But the scripture so taketh not alone ner we so meane / as Master More knoweth well ynough. Vvhen an horse bereth a sadell and a <note place="margin">similitude</note> man therin / we maye well saye / that the horse only and alone bereth the sadell / and is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lpe of the man in beringe therof.

Euery man that hath witte / hath a will to and then by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster mores argument / witte only geueth not the light of vnderstondynge. Now the conclusion is false ād the contrary true. For the witte with out helpe of the will geueth the light of the vnderstondynge / nether doeth the will worke
<pb facs="tcp:176385:126"/> at all / vntyll the wytt haue determined thys or that to be good or bad. Now what is faith saue a spirituall lyght of vnderstōdinge ād an inwar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de knowlege or felynge of marcie. Out of why<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch knowlege loue doeth springe. But loue brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght me not that knowlege / for I knew yt yer I loued. So that loue in the processe off nature to dyspute from the cause to the effecte helpeth not at all to the felynge that God is mercifull to me no moare than the louynge herte and kynd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havoure of an obedyent wyfe to hir husbonde / maketh hyr se hys loue and kyndenesse to hir / for many soch haue vnkynde husbandes. But by hys kynde dedes to hir doeth she se his loue.

                  <p>Oure loue and good werkes make not god first loue vs / and thaunge hym from hate to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue / as the Turke / Iew and vayne popish mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne but hys loue and dedes make vs loue and chaunge vs from hate to loue.

                  <p>And yet my workes make not my loue ner my loue my fayth ner my fayth Gods mercye: But contrary / Gods mercye maketh my fayth and my fayth my loue and my loue my workes.

                  <p>And when Paul saith faith only iustifieth: and Iames / that a man is iustified by werkes and not by fayth only / there is greate difference betwene Pauls only and Iameses only. For Paules only is to be vnderstonde / that fayth iustifieth in the hert and before god / wyth out helpe of werkes / ye and yer I can worke.

                  <p> For Paul saith Roma. iiij. if Abraham ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue workes / he hath wherof to reioce / but not before god.
